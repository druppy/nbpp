Where to find nb++

What's new in this release?
---------------------------

See the file NEWS.


Build instructions
------------------

The default installation prefix is /usr/local.  To install there, type "./configure; make;
make install".  To install somewhere else, use the option "--prefix=<path>" with
"configure".

To run the regression tests, type "make check".

gcc does not yet (as of version 2.95.2) support exceptions in shared libraries on some
platforms.  We have encountered this problem on HP/UX.  As a workaround, you can use nb++
as a static library.  When building, use the option "--enable-static-tests" with
"configure".  For production code, you may also wish to build nb++ without debugging
information to reduce the size of the executable; use "--disable-debug" with "configure".
gcc exception handling is known to work with shared libraries on x86 GNU/Linux platforms.

See the file INSTALL for detailed instructions.


Documentation
-------------

The manual is provided in Texinfo format.  If you have Info, type "info nb++" after
installation to read the manual.  The API documentation is in HTML format, and is
installed in <prefix>/share/nb++/doc.


Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

GNU/Linux: Programs linked to nb++ must also be linked to pthread.
